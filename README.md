# My Keyboards
Files connected with my keyboard - code, stl, and photos
My current main keyboards:
* Corne 
* Dactyl

## Corne
### Details:
* 32 keys + 4 thumb clusters (planning on adding 4 extra))
* Bluetooth, Nice!nano, hotswap
* kinda works with Mac, but the modifiers aren't great to use
* The code is in a different [repo](https://github.com/MikeF404/no-view-corne-config)
* The bottom part has slots for easier grip, battery slot and screw holes

## Dactyl
* focus on cross-platform (Windows + Mac with a KVM switch)
* 70 keys, wired - Teensy 2.0 (Elite-C should work also)
* No PCB - fully hardwired
